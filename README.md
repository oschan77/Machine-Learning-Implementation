# Machine-Learning-Implementation

This is a repository that contains implementations of various machine learning models from scratch and the implementations are written in plain Python and NumPy, or PyTorch.

## About

The Machine-Learning-Implementation repository is intended for learning more about the inner workings of machine learning models or use bare-bones implementations for their own projects. Also, they allow for a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms and techniques. 

Each implemented model is self-contained, developed and tested in Google Colab, making it easy to experiment and learn in a cloud-based environment. Additionally, these implementations can also be seamlessly used in local Jupyter notebooks for further exploration and development. 

## Implemented Models

Here are the models that have been implemented so far:

1. **Linear Regression** - (Python and NumPy)
2. **Logistic Regression** - (Python and NumPy)
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - (Python and NumPy)
4. **Naive Bayes** - (Python and NumPy)
5. **Neural Networks** - (Python and NumPy)
6. **Neural Networks** - (PyTorch)
7. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** - (PyTorch)

_More models will be added in the future._
